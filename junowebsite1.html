<h1> Juno the Finnish Lapphund! </h1>
<h3> Breed History</h3>
<p> The Finnish Lapphund are an arctic spitz herding breed descendant from the harsh Lapland region of northern Finland, Sweden, Norway and Russia.  They were traditionally used as working dogs by Sami farmers in the care of their reindeer herds.
  An ancient breed that have been used as working dogs by the Sami people for centuries, they are new as a recognised breed in the dog world, the first breed standard being written in 1945 and only being known by their current name since 1993.
  They are particularly new to Australia, with the first arriving in 1995. </p>
