<h2> Breed History</h2>
<p> The Finnish Lapphund are an arctic spitz herding breed descendant from the harsh Lapland region of northern Finland, Sweden, Norway and Russia.  They were traditionally used as working dogs by Sami farmers in the care of their reindeer herds.
  An ancient breed that have been used as working dogs by the Sami people for centuries, they are new as a recognised breed in the dog world, the first breed standard being written in 1945 and only being known by their current name since 1993.
  They are particularly new to Australia, with the first arriving in 1995. </p>

  <h2> AKC Breed Standard  </h2>
  <p>
    The Finnish Lapphund is a medium sized breed that combines the look of the northern type dog with the temperament of the herding dog. They are intelligent, alert, agile,
    friendly and eager to learn. Developed to live and work outside, north of the Arctic Circle, the breed is strongly built and thickly coated. These dogs were never intended as guardians, and are
    particularly submissive towards people. Despite its strength, the Finnish Lapphund conveys acertain softness, particularly in expression. Males are recognizably masculine and females
    feminine.

<h2> Juno Biography</h2>
<p>
  Juno was born on November 18, 2021 in Middleton, New York, from a small hobby breeder dedicated to preserving the breed and growing its presence in the United States.
  He meets all breed standards with black and tan coloring, with a large and thick double coat, and lovely demeanor and willingness to please. He came home to live with me
  and has become a wonderful part of the family. He weighs 40lbs, stands at about 20 inches tall, and is the most affectionate puppy who loves to play.
